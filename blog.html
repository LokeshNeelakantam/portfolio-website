                    <h4>Introduction</h4>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to show my skills in a better way than only a PDF resume.
                        So I created my own resume website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                        In this blog, I explain how I built this website and what I learned.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
                    <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>

                    <h4>Website Sections</h4>
                    <p>
                        My resume website contains sections like About, Skills,
                        Experience, Projects, Education and Certifications.
                        This makes the website easy to understand for recruiters.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Navigation Bar and Smooth Scroll</h4>
                    <p>
                        I created a navigation bar at the top.
                        When I click on a menu item, the page scrolls smoothly
                        to that section using JavaScript.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Glassmorphism Design</h4>
                    <p>
                        I used a glass-style design with blur effect and transparent
                        background to make the website look modern and professional.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Dark Mode Feature</h4>
                    <p>
                        I added a dark mode button.
                        When the button is clicked, the website switches
                        between dark and light mode using JavaScript.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
                    <p>
                        I used media queries so the website works well on
                        mobile, tablet and desktop screens.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                    <p>
                        This project helped me understand HTML structure,
                        CSS styling, JavaScript interaction, and responsive web design.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                        Building this resume website improved my frontend skills
                        and helped me present my profile professionally.
